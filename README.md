# >_ Root the Box

A Game of Hackers
-------------------
Root the Box is a real-time scoring engine for a computer wargames where hackers can practice and learn. 
The application can be easily modified for any hacker CTF game. Root the Box attempts to engage novice and experienced 
hackers alike by combining a fun game-like environment, with realistic challenges that convey knowledge applicable 
to real-world penetration testing. Just as in traditional CTF games, each team attacks targets of varying difficulty 
and sophistication, attempting to collect flags. However in Root the Box, teams can also create "Botnets" by uploading
a small bot program to target machines. Teams are periodically rewarded with (in-game) money for each bot in their botnet;
the larger the botnet the larger the reward.

Money can be used to unlock new levels, buy hints to flags, download a target's source code, or even "SWAT" other players by bribing the (in-game) police.

Player's "bank account passwords" are also publically displayed by the scoring engine, allowing players to crack each other's passwords and steal each other's money.
